    <h1>Benefits of Renewable Energy</h1>
    <p class="red">Renewable energy comes from natural sources like the sun, wind, and water, which never run out. It produces little
    pollution compared to fossil fuels, helping to reduce greenhouse gases and protect the environment. Using renewable
    energy also creates jobs and reduces dependence on imported fuels, making energy more secure.</p>

    natural resources and supports healthier communities. Overall, renewable energy is a clean, sustainable way to power our
